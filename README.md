1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

*Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed *

Running automated tests every time code is pushed to GitHub is the best way to catch problems early. This way, any new code is automatically tested to make sure it doesnâ€™t break existing features. It also helps the team find bugs quickly, making it easier to fix them before they become bigger issues. This method keeps the project more stable and makes it easier to work together, knowing the code is always tested and reliable.
